# Introduction

In this exercise, you will work on a spatial interaction model that combines the skills that you developed in Reading 4, and those you practiced previously in terms of visualizing geo-spatial information and estimating regression models. *The objective of the exercise will be to compare the potential of different neighborhoods in the City of Hamilton to support mobility by walking. You will work with network data and will see how different network configurations, along with the distribution of opportunities in the landscape, can facilitate or hinder mobility, and increase or decrease accessibility. You will be asked to think about the different configurations, how they came to be, and what is their potential legacy in terms of future mobility and accessibility.*

* Before working on this exercise, it is strongly recommended that you have completed the following reading.
    + Reading-4 ('Spatial Interaction Analysis', available as a template in your course package)
* Due date:	See course outline for due date.
* Materials: the following data objects are used in this exercise (available in your course package)
    + `hamilton_graph`
    + `hamilton_taz`
    + `hamilton_taz_employment`
    + `hamilton_taz_ph`
    + `hamilton_taz_travel`
    + `od_full`
    
## Preliminaries

Begin by clearing the workspace and loading the packages that you will need for this exercise. For instance, you will need the `tidy_graph` package to work with the road network. Make sure all packages that you need are installed and loaded `library()`. 
```{r message=FALSE}
library(envsocty3LT3) # Course package
library(igraph) # Package for network analysis
library(scales) # This package provides scales functions for visualization 
library(sf) # Package to work with geospatial information in simple features format
library(tidygraph) # Package to work with spatial networks
library(tidyverse) # Family of packages for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization
library(units) # Package for working with units in `R`
```

Load the data. These are the same data objects that you saw in Reading 4:
```{r}
data("hamilton_graph")
data("hamilton_taz")
data("hamilton_taz_employment")
data("hamilton_taz_ph")
data("hamilton_taz_travel")
data("od_full")```

# Questions

## Spatial interaction analysis in the Hamilton CMA (85 marks)

1. How many different types of links are there in the road network? (5)

2. Assume travel speeds for different types of links. Explain your assumptions. The types of links in the OpenStreetMaps classification can be found [here](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:highway) (5)

3. Use the traffic analysis zones and road network with the speeds you assumed in (2) to calculate the shortest path inter-centroid travel time. What is the diameter of the network in travel time? (20) 

4. Join the travel time to the origin-destination table for further analysis (10)

5. What is the trip length distribution of shopping trips? Hint: use `cut()` to create a categorical variable with suitable travel time intervals (you may need to experiment with different intervals); then group by that variable, and `summarize()` to sum all trips by group (see for example lines 409, 418, and 427 of Reading-4. Discuss the results of plotting the trip length distribution (20)

6. Join the attributes of the traffic analysis zones to the origin-destination table. With the information available calibrate a gravity model for shopping trips. Hint: remember to filter `Trips_shop` > 0. Plot and discuss the distance-decay function (20)

7. Suppose that you are planning to open a new business, and that you have a target demographic by household income. What is the name of your business? Choose one type of household by income level from your data as your target demographic (e.g., Inc_less_15k). Then choose two traffic analysis zones (the centroid is fine for this analysis) and calculate the market potential of your store. The market potential is the accessibility of your business to households of your target demographic. Which of the two zones you identified would be best for your new business and why? (20)
