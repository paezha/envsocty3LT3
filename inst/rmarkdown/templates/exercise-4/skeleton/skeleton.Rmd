# Introduction

In this exercise, you will work on a spatial interaction model that combines the skills that you developed in Reading 4, and those you practiced previously in terms of visualizing geo-spatial information and estimating regression models. The objective of the exercise will be to compare the potential of different neighborhoods in the City of Hamilton to support mobility by walking. You will work with network data and will see how different network configurations, along with the distribution of opportunities in the landscape, can facilitate or hinder mobility, and increase or decrease accessibility. You will be asked to think about the different configurations, how they came to be, and what is their potential legacy in terms of future mobility and accessibility.

* Before working on this exercise, it is strongly recommended that you have completed the following reading.
    + Reading-4 ('Spatial Interaction Analysis', available as a template in your course package)
* Due date:	See course outline for due date.
* Materials: the following data objects are used in this exercise (available in your course package)
    + `hamilton_graph`
    + `hamilton_taz`
    + `hamilton_taz_employment`
    + `hamilton_taz_ph`
    + `hamilton_taz_travel`
    + `od_full`
    
## Preliminaries

Begin by clearing the workspace and loading the packages that you will need for this exercise. For instance, you will need the `tidy_graph` package to work with the road network. Make sure all packages that you need are installed and loaded `library()`. 
```{r message=FALSE}
library(envsocty3LT3) # Course package
library(igraph) # Package for network analysis
library(scales) # This package provides scales functions for visualization 
library(sf) # Package to work with geospatial information in simple features format
library(tidygraph) # Package to work with spatial networks
library(tidyverse) # Family of packages for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization
library(units) # Package for working with units in `R`
```

Load the data. These are the same data objects that you saw in Reading 4:
```{r}
data("hamilton_graph")
data("hamilton_taz")
data("hamilton_taz_employment")
data("hamilton_taz_ph")
data("hamilton_taz_travel")
data("od_full")
```

# Context

Spatial interaction modelling makes use of data collected in travel surveys to estimate movement between origins and destinations. These models are important for understanding travel trends and planning for transportation needs. This is particularly useful for under-prioritized modes of travel, such as bicycling, because it is possible to determine trip flows by bicycle and to identify whether infrastructure is sufficient to connect those traffic analysis zones.

For example, a recent [paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11116-021-10197-1?wt_mc=Internal.Event.1.SEM.ArticleAuthorOnlineFirst&utm_source=ArticleAuthorOnlineFirst&utm_medium=email&utm_content=AA_en_06082018&ArticleAuthorOnlineFirst_20210611), published by a graduate student at McMaster, used data from the 2016 Transportation Tomorrow Survey to investigate the built environment correlates of bicycling flows in Hamilton. The model was able to determine what correlates with the production of bicycle trips at the origin and the attraction of trips at destinations. Some trip flows had more bicycle trips than predicted by the model, which suggests that there is supportive infrastructure for bicyclists to travel between these zones. Spatial interaction models are an important part of the four-stages transportation model in step two for trip distribution.

In addition to trip data, which can be derived from travel surveys like the TTS, spatial interaction models also include spatial data about the urban form. The urban form or structure, meaning the physical characteristics and configuration of cities, affects the location and quantity of goods, services, and opportunities (e.g., jobs) that are available to people. Therefore, the urban form interacts with local transportation systems and affects movement between origins and destinations â€“ people make trips from one traffic analysis zone to another to access desired amenities. It is important to think about the urban form in spatial interaction modelling because it explains what activities generate (e.g., residential areas) or attract movements (e.g., job opportunities), and help us better understand what affects specific trip purposes like shopping trips.

# Questions

## Spatial interaction analysis in the Hamilton CMA (85 marks)

1. How many different types of links are there in the road network? (5)

2. Assume travel speeds for different types of links. Explain your assumptions. The types of links in the OpenStreetMaps classification can be found [here](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:highway) (10)

3. Use the traffic analysis zones and road network with the speeds you assumed in (2) to calculate the shortest path inter-centroid travel time. What is the diameter of the network in travel time? (10) 

4. Join the travel time to the origin-destination table for further analysis. What is the trip length distribution of shopping trips? Hint: use `cut()` to create a categorical variable with suitable travel time intervals (you may need to experiment with different intervals); then group by that variable, and `summarize()` to sum all trips by group (see for example lines 409, 418, and 427 of Reading-4). Discuss the results of plotting the trip length distribution. Does the distribution surprise you or challenge your understanding of shopping trips? (15)

5. Join the attributes of the traffic analysis zones to the origin-destination table. With the information available, calibrate a gravity model for shopping trips. Hint: remember to filter `Trips_shop` > 0. Plot and discuss the distance-decay function. (15)

6. Suppose that you are planning to open a new business and that you have a target demographic by household income. What is the name of your business? Choose one type of household by income level from your data as your target demographic (e.g., Inc_less_15k). Then choose two traffic analysis zones (the centroid is fine for this analysis) and calculate the market potential of your store. The market potential is the accessibility of your business to households of your target demographic. Which of the two zones identified would be best for your new business and why? (20)

7. Think about the distance-decay function that you produced in (5) and that you used in (6). Could you use it to discuss accessibility by different modes? Explain. If not, what would you need to do to explain accessibility by different modes? (10)
