# Introduction

For this exercise, you will work on a problem that requires you to develop a delivery schedule. For this. you will use the transportation problem

<!--In this exercise, you will work on a spatial interaction model that combines the skills that you developed in Reading 4, and those you practiced previously in terms of visualizing geo-spatial information and estimating regression models. The objective of the exercise will be to compare the potential of different neighborhoods in the City of Hamilton to support mobility by walking. You will work with network data and will see how different network configurations, along with the distribution of opportunities in the landscape, can facilitate or hinder mobility, and increase or decrease accessibility. You will be asked to think about the different configurations, how they came to be, and what is their potential legacy in terms of future mobility and accessibility.
-->

## Context

As discussed in the project description of the City of Hamilton's Truck Route Master Plan (TRMP) review study [https://www.hamilton.ca/city-planning/master-plans-class-eas/truck-route-master-plan], the City of Hamilton is a goods movement gateway between Southern Ontario and international markets because of its the goods movement corridors (rail lines, highways) and intermodal freight facilities (airport, port, rail yards). "Trucks also support the quality of life for residents and the economic vitality of local businesses by transporting goods - such as consumer items, industry components and products, construction equipment and materials - to, from and within Hamilton" including removal of waste products (City's waste management) and support services that enhance neighbourhood quality of life. "However, because of their increased size and weight and potential safety and environmental impacts, the movement of trucks needs special consideration."

According to Ontario Trucking Association's guidelines [https://ontruck.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/OTA-Local-Truck-Routes-A-Guide-FINAL_public.pdf], considerations for selecting a truck route are as follows: 

- "To provide safe, efficient and connective routes to best service commercial and non-commercial truck travel while minimizing impact to surrounding communities.
- To provide a seamless transition between external truck traffic and the internal road network
- To provide easy access to truck information in the form of consistent, readable and accurate signage, readily available maps and reduced time and weight restrictions".

"Any municipality, regardless of size, has the ability to develop a set of rules and policies that ensure future development does not impede the flow of goods. Each community has different characteristics and, therefore, different transportation needs. Smaller municipalities with less money to spend on capital-intensive projects can add freight-conscious policies into their Official Plan, while larger jurisdictions with greater populations and greater freight movement concerns may undertake larger projects" [https://ontruck.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/OTA-Local-Truck-Routes-A-Guide-FINAL_public.pdf].

With a more focus on community livability and economic development, "the City of Hamilton operates a designated truck route network  [https://www.hamilton.ca/city-planning/master-plans-class-eas/truck-route-master-plan] that designates where truck traffic can travel in order to:

- Recognize and minimize the impacts of truck traffic on the interests of the greater community such as safety, congestion, noise, and air quality
- Support economic and employment activities
- Support the safe and efficient movement of goods and services
- Protect the City’s road infrastructure that cannot bear heavy loads or roads where truck traffic would be unsuitable (e.g. narrow lanes, weight restrictions on bridges)".

However, the previous Truck Route Master Plan (TRMP) of 2010 is not free of criticism [https://www.environmenthamilton.org/truckroute_reboot_petition]. According to the local advocates "We need local delivery trucks in our neighbourhoods, but massive industrial trucks with no local destination create serious safety concerns when they cut through residential areas. Unfortunately, this is currently perfectly legal under Hamilton’s permissive truck route system". This is something on which the local leaders advocates are trying get the attention of the City of Hamilton.

# Questions

The task at hand is as follows:

Paez Pop is a small craft root beer manufacturer. To preserve quality, the company produces their fair trade, organic, probiotic root beer in only two plants, A and B, where the secret ingredient is readily available. From these two plants, the root beer is shipped to four stores (Store I, II, III, and IV). Because of the increased cost of diesel, shipping cost has become a major expense for the company, so they have hired you to determine whether shipping costs can be reduced. 

The plant production managers have estimated the output from their respective plants, as follows:

* Plant A: output is 20 truckloads of root beer
* Plant B: output is 40 truckloads of root beer

The CEO of Paez Pop has allocated the total output to the given warehouses by examining sales data from prior months, as follows:

* Store I: 15 truckloads of root beer
* Store II: 10 truckloads of root beer
* Store III: 20 truckloads of root beer
* Store IV: 15 truckloads of root beer

Currently, the cost of transportation in dollars per truckload is as shown in the next table for each of the routes:

Plant/Distribution  | Store I | Store II  | Store III  | Store IV
------------------- | ------- | ------    | --------   | --------
Plant A             | 290     | 280       | 500        | 250  
Plant B             | 260     | 290       | 200        | 500

The current delivery schedule that the company uses is shown in the table below. The unit of measurement is the truckload:

Plant/Distribution  | Store I | Store II  | Store III  | Store IV  | Supply
------------------- | ------- | ------    | --------   | --------  | ------
Plant A             | 10      | 5         | 0          |  5        | 20
Plant B             |  5      | 5         | 20         | 10        | 40
Demand              | 15      | 10        | 20         | 15

```{r}
290 * 10 + 280 * 5 + 500 * 0 + 250 * 5 + 260 * 5 + 290 * 5 + 200 * 20 + 500 * 10
```


Your job is to determine the quantity (i.e., the number of truckloads) of root beer that should be shipped from each plant to each warehouse so that the company's total shipping cost is minimized.

To begin, choose _one_ node from each column in the following table of node identifiers (nodeID in the `hamilton_graph`). You need a node for the location of the two plants and the four stores:
            
Plant A | Plant B | Store I | Store II | Store III | Store IV
--------|---------|---------|----------|-----------|----------
  8940  |  19259  |   1156  |   10733  |   14096   |   13773  
 19172  |  19669  |  17193  |   15321  |   15321   |   16104
 25305  |  25625  |  23136  |   15719  |           |   23571
 25430  |         |         |          |           |

## Optimal delivery of Paez Pop in the Hamilton CMA (85 marks)

1. Calculate the cost of of transportation according to the current delivery schedule (10)

2. Find the shortest-path distances from the plants to the stores and obtain a cost matrix (use a rate of $14/km per truckload) (10)

3. Create the initial simplex tableau for this problem (20)

4. Solve the problem using the simplex method, and create a table showing the optimized flows that you have generated for their distribution system. What is the minimized cost, and how much savings have you found for the company? (30)

5. The key to consulting is getting repeat business from your clients, so you're happy when the CEO of Paez Pop calls you back months later to ask you to do some more work.

His company's root beer has become so successful that they now estimate potential demand at Store I and Store IV has increased by 10 truckloads of root beer a month, at each of the two stores. This extra demand has been going unmet, for now, because they haven't yet had the ability to expand production capacity at either plant, and haven't modified their distribution system since you optimized it for them in question 2.

Paez Pop has now saved up enough money to expand one, and only one, of their two plants by 20 truckloads of extra root beer production, so they can meet this new demand. The CEO knows the two plants have different transportation costs to the four stores, so he is wondering if you can tell him which of the two facilities he should expand, in order to minimize his company's transportation costs.

Find which plant, when its production is increased by 20, will find Paez Pop the higher savings. (15)

NEW QUESTION

4. A few years pass, and Paez Pop has continued to expand. They have now added afternoon and night shifts, bringing total production at each plant up to 100 truckloads of beer a month. As well, as their brand has become more popular they have seen increased demand at the four original stores, and they have even started supplying their root beer to two new stores (Store V and Store VI). 

Instead of coming to you to redesign their distribution system, they've just added transportation routes in an ad-hoc manner, so their current distribution system now looks like this:

Plant/Distribution  | Store I | Store II  | Store III  | Store IV  | Store V | Store VI | Supply
------------------- | ------- | ------    | --------   | --------  | ------  | -------- | ------
Plant A             | 30      | 0         | 0          | 40        | 0       | 30       |  100
Plant B             | 10      | 20        | 30         | 0         | 40      | 0        |  100
Demand              | 40      | 20        | 30         | 40        | 40      | 30       | 

Their transportation costs haven't changed for Stores I-IV. Transportation costs to the two new stores are as follows:

Plant/Distribution  | Store V | Store VI  
------------------- | ------- | ------   
Plant A             | 680     | 190       
Plant B             | 400     | 460      

They have now come back to you to optimize their distribution system again. Determine minimized cost, create a chart of optimal flows, and state how much money you've saved them. (30)

NEW QUESTION

5. Paez Pop is thinking of trying to reduce costs by investing in a new, futuristic transportation trend: they're going to fire all their truck drivers at Plant B, and replace them with shiny new electric-powered autonomous vehicles from Tesla. They think this will save them 20% on all transport costs from plant B to each of the six stores. 

(Plant A's truck drivers can't be replaced because they're unionized, so Plant A's transport costs will remain the same.)

By how many percent would this plan reduce Paez Pop's total transport costs in a new optimized network? What do the flows look like now? (15)

NEW QUESTION MAYBE?

Think of a technological development, for instance, unbreakable glass bottles that reduce the cost of shipping. So if the cost of adopting this technology is X, and the cost of shipment is reduced by Y% while increasing sales by Z%, does it make sense to adopt the technology. Or, how long would it take to recoup the investment?

NEW QUESTION?

6. Neighbors have complained about trucks in residential neighborhoods, how would things change is all local streets were closed to trucks. 

NEW VERSION?

Make it instead of an individual exercise something that students can do in pairs and compete.
