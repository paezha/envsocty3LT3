# Introduction

In this exercise, you will use the geospatial visualization capabilities available in `R` to analyze trends pertaining to travel in the Hamilton Census Metropolitan Area (CMA). The objective of the exercise is to practice skills displaying and manipulating spatial information, to demonstrate the ability to analyze spatial data, and to gain a better understanding of transportation trends in this metropolitan area surrounding McMaster University. These skills will give you an opportunity to explore different ways in which data from the Transportation Tomorrow Survey can be useful for transportation decisions.

* Before working on this exercise, it is strongly recommended that you have completed one reading.
    + Reading-2 ('Geospatial Visualization for Transportation Trends using R', available as a template in your course package)
* Due date:	See course outline for due date.
* Materials: the following data objects are used in this exercise (available in your course package)
    + `hamilton_taz`
    + `hamilton_taz_ph`
    + `hamilton_taz_travel`
    + `travel_cost_car`

# Instructions

Change the name of the file to `exercise-2-studentnumber.Rmd`. 

Provide your answers by typing them in this R Markdown document. Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*. Remember to write the highlights of this exercise and the threshold concepts in the header section where you entered your personal information!

When you are done working on this exercise, _knit_ the file to create the pdf file for submission.

# Preliminaries

Again, you want to clear the working space to make sure that you do not have extraneous items there when you begin your work. The command in R to clear the work space is `rm` (for "remove"), followed by a list of items to be removed. To clear the work space from _all_ objects, do the following:
```{r}
rm(list = ls())
```

Begin by loading the packages that you will need for this exercise. Make sure that the packages are installed before trying to load them with `library()`. 
```{r}
library(envsocty3LT3) # Course package
library(sf) # Package for working with geospatial information
library(tidyverse) # Package for data carpentry and data analysis
```

Load the data objects that you will need for this exercise:
```{r}
data("hamilton_taz")
data("hamilton_taz_ph")
data("hamilton_taz_travel")
```

You can consult the documentation of these data objects by going to their help file (e.g., `?hamilton_taz`).

Remember that you can use the [`join_` functions]() in the package `dplyr` to join tables that have a common variable. For example, this is how you would join the table with travel-related information to the boundaries of the traffic analysis zones:
```{r}
hamilton_taz <- left_join(hamilton_taz,
                          hamilton_taz_travel,
                          by = "GTA06")
```

# Context

Data about urban and rural travel are needed to inform transportation planning decisions at the local and regional levels. The survey data collected by the Transportation Tomorrow Survey (TTS) every five years include [information](http://www.tts2016.ca/en/survey-questions.php) about the household, all people living in the household, and all trips made by each person 11 years or older on the previous day. Data from the TTS are then used to forecast transportation trends and demand, and to identify future investments for transportation infrastructure.

In the case of Hamilton, the [City-Wide Transportation Master Plan](https://www.hamilton.ca/sites/default/files/media/browser/2018-10-24/tmp-review-update-final-report-oct2018.pdf) highlights different ways in which data from the TTS have been used to inform transportation planning decisions. As an example, look at Figure 2.2. on page 149 of the Transportation Master Plan, which shows a decline in the number of people between the ages of 16 and 25 who possess a driver's license in Hamilton between 1996 and 2011. 

As noted in the Plan, "Municipalities use data from the TTS to gain a better understanding of travel patterns. It also allows them to monitor these patterns temporally. Using TTS allows municipalities to monitor their modal split providing goals for multimodal diversification and identify route flow in support of target improvement" [page 149](https://www.hamilton.ca/sites/default/files/media/browser/2018-10-24/tmp-review-update-final-report-oct2018.pdf). Hamilton's 4-stage transportation model, which was used to guide the City-Wide Transportation Master Plan adopted in 2018, made use of data from the 2011 TTS.

In this exercise, you will have the opportunity to learn about socioeconomic, demographic, and travel trends in the Hamilton CMA that are important for understanding and planning for transportation needs.

# Questions

## Transportation Trends in Hamilton (85 marks)

1.	What was the total population of the Hamilton CMA in 2011? Choose a mode of transportation in the table `hamilton_taz_travel`. What was the total number of trips by that mode in the Hamilton CMA? What was the proportion of trips by that mode, with respect to the total number of trips by all modes? (hint: use the function `mutate()`) (10 marks)


2.	Were there any zones that did not produce any trips by that mode according to the TTS? (5 marks)


3.	Create a thematic map to show the proportion of trips by your chosen mode across TAZ in the Hamilton CMA, and discuss the pattern in the resulting map. (20 marks)


4.  Create a thematic map showing population density in the Hamilton CMA. (10 marks)


5.	Create a scatterplot to visualize the relationship between population density and the proportion of trips by the mode you chose. What relationship do you see? (10 marks)


6. Do a simple linear regression between the proportion of trips by your chosen mode across TAZ and population density. Discuss the results of your model. (25 marks)


7. What other attributes of a TAZ do you think might correlate with proportion of trips by the mode you chose? Explain. (5 marks)
