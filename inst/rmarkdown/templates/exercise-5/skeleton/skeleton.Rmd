# Introduction

For this exercise, you will work on a problem that requires you to develop a delivery schedule based on your learning from Reading 5 and the Transportation Problem document available in the A2L. For this. you will use a freight transportation problem and apply your learning to determine the transportation cost for freight transport, and shortest path to minimize the cost. Also, by exploring the strategies of goods distribution, you will find the solution to optimize the flows and minimize transportation costs. Lastly, you will determine the optimum goods flow schedule to minimize the cost when demand for goods increases and therefore, company increases the production and supply.


* Before working on this exercise, it is strongly recommended that you have completed the following readings.
    + `Transportation Problem.pdf` (available with your contents in Avenue to Learn)

## Context

The City of Hamilton is a goods movement gateway between Southern Ontario and international markets, a role it enjoys thanks to goods movement corridors (rail lines, highways) and intermodal freight facilities (airport, port, rail yards). As noted in the City of Hamilton's Truck Route Master Plan ([TRMP](https://www.hamilton.ca/city-planning/master-plans-class-eas/truck-route-master-plan)) review study, "[t]rucks...support the quality of life for residents and the economic vitality of local businesses by transporting goods - such as consumer items, industry components and products, construction equipment and materials - to, from and within Hamilton". This includes removal of waste products (City's waste management) and support services that enhance neighbourhood quality of life. At the same time, the movement of trucks requires special consideration to account for "their increased size and weight and potential safety and environmental impacts."

According to Ontario Trucking Association's [guidelines](https://ontruck.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/OTA-Local-Truck-Routes-A-Guide-FINAL_public.pdf), there are a number of considerations for selecting truck routes:

- To provide safe, efficient and connective routes to best service commercial and non-commercial truck travel while minimizing impact to surrounding communities.
- To provide a seamless transition between external truck traffic and the internal road network
- To provide easy access to truck information in the form of consistent, readable and accurate signage, readily available maps and reduced time and weight restrictions.

Local communities need the ability to develop rules and policies to facilitate the flow of goods. The Ontario Trucking Association recommends that municipalities develop plans that are freight-conscious depending on their ability to invest in projects. Accordingly, "[s]maller municipalities with less money to spend on capital-intensive projects can add freight-conscious policies into their Official Plan, while larger jurisdictions with greater populations and greater freight movement concerns may undertake larger projects".

The economic importance of the movement of goods, however, need to pay attention to the different characteristics and needs of the communities they pass through and/or serve. The 2010 Truck Route Master Plan (TRMP) of the City of Hamilton was not [free of criticism](https://www.environmenthamilton.org/truckroute_reboot_petition) in this respect. According to the local advocates, "we need local delivery trucks in our neighbourhoods, but massive industrial trucks with no local destination create serious safety concerns when they cut through residential areas. Unfortunately, this is currently perfectly legal under Hamilton’s permissive truck route system". This is something on which the local leaders advocates worked to [bring to the attention](https://www.hamiltonnews.com/news-story/9248810-hamilton-s-proposed-truck-route-review-will-emphasize-safe-streets-for-residents/) of the City of Hamilton.  

With its renewed focus on community livability and economic development, the City of Hamilton has adopted a master plan that aims to balance the needs of freight movement and the livability of neighbourhoods. In this way, the city has created a [designated truck route network](https://www.hamilton.ca/city-planning/master-plans-class-eas/truck-route-master-plan) in order to:

- Recognize and minimize the impacts of truck traffic on the interests of the greater community such as safety, congestion, noise, and air quality
- Support economic and employment activities
- Support the safe and efficient movement of goods and services
- Protect the City’s road infrastructure that cannot bear heavy loads or roads where truck traffic would be unsuitable (e.g. narrow lanes, weight restrictions on bridges).

Clearly, the movement of goods has impacts for the local economy and the livability of a region, so its study is an important component in transportation planning. 

# Questions

The task at hand is as follows:

Paez Pop is a small craft root beer manufacturer. To preserve quality, the company produces their fair trade, organic, probiotic root beer in only two plants, A and B, where the secret ingredient is readily available. From these two plants, the root beer is shipped to four stores (Store I, II, III, and IV). Because of the increased cost of diesel, shipping cost has become a major expense for the company, so they have hired you to determine whether shipping costs can be reduced. 

The plant production managers have estimated the output from their respective plants, as follows:

* Plant A: output is 20 truckloads of root beer
* Plant B: output is 40 truckloads of root beer

The CEO of Paez Pop has allocated the total output to the given warehouses by examining sales data from prior months, as follows:

* Store I: 15 truckloads of root beer
* Store II: 10 truckloads of root beer
* Store III: 20 truckloads of root beer
* Store IV: 15 truckloads of root beer

Currently, the cost of transportation in dollars per truckload for the whole route is as shown in the next table for each of the routes:

Plant/Distribution  | Store I | Store II  | Store III  | Store IV
------------------- | ------- | ------    | --------   | --------
Plant A             | 290     | 280       | 500        | 250  
Plant B             | 260     | 290       | 200        | 500

The current delivery schedule that the company uses is shown in the table below. The unit of measurement is the truckload:

Plant/Distribution  | Store I | Store II  | Store III  | Store IV  | Supply
------------------- | ------- | ------    | --------   | --------  | ------
Plant A             | 10      | 5         | 0          |  5        | 20
Plant B             |  5      | 5         | 20         | 10        | 40
Demand              | 15      | 10        | 20         | 15

Your job is to determine the quantity (i.e., the number of truckloads) of root beer that should be shipped from each plant to each warehouse so that the company's total shipping cost is minimized.

To begin, choose _one_ node from each column in the following table of node identifiers (nodeID in the `hamilton_graph`). You need a node for the location of the two plants and the four stores:
            
Plant A | Plant B | Store I | Store II | Store III | Store IV
--------|---------|---------|----------|-----------|----------
  8940  |  19259  |   1156  |   10733  |   14096   |   13773  
 19172  |  19669  |  17193  |   15321  |   15321   |   16104
 25305  |  25625  |  23136  |   15719  |           |   23571
 25430  |         |         |          |           |

## Optimal delivery of Paez Pop in the Hamilton CMA (85 marks)

1. Calculate the cost of of transportation according to the current delivery schedule (10)

2. Find the shortest-path distances from the plants to the stores and obtain a cost matrix (use a rate of $14/km per truckload) (10)

3. Create the initial simplex tableau for this problem (20)

4. Solve the problem using the simplex method, and create a table showing the optimized flows that you have generated for their distribution system. What is the minimized cost, and how much savings have you found for the company? (30)

5. The key to consulting is getting repeat business from your clients, so you're happy when the CEO of Paez Pop calls you back months later to ask you to do some more work.

His company's root beer has become so successful that they now estimate potential demand at Store I and Store IV has increased by 10 truckloads of root beer a month, at each of the two stores. This extra demand has been going unmet, for now, because they haven't yet had the ability to expand production capacity at either plant, and haven't modified their distribution system since you optimized it for them in question 2.

Paez Pop has now saved up enough money to expand one, and only one, of their two plants by 20 truckloads of extra root beer production, so they can meet this new demand. The CEO knows the two plants have different transportation costs to the four stores, so he is wondering if you can tell him which of the two facilities he should expand, in order to minimize his company's transportation costs.

Find which plant, when its production is increased by 20, will find Paez Pop the higher savings. (15)
