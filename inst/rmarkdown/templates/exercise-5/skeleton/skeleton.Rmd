#Preliminaries

Begin by clearing the workspace and loading the datasets that you will need for this exercise. They are available from the Readings section. For instance, you will need the `rgdal` package to read the shape file. Make sure all packages that you need are installed and loaded `library()`. 
```{r echo=FALSE}
rm(list = ls())
```

The task at hand is as follows:

Paez Pop is a small craft root beer manufacturer. To preserve quality, the company produces their fair trade, organic, probiotic root beer in only two plants, A and B, where spring water is readily available. From these two plants, the root beer is shipped to four stores (Store I, II, III, and IV). Because of the increased cost of diesel, shipping cost has become a major expense for the company, so they have hired you to determine whether shipping costs can be reduced. 

The plant production managers have estimated the output from their respective plants, as follows:

* Plant A: output is 20 truckloads of root beer
* Plant B: output is 40 truckloads of root beer

The CEO of Paez Pop has allocated the total output to the given warehouses by examining sales data from prior months, as follows:

* Store I: 15 truckloads of root beer
* Store II: 10 truckloads of root beer
* Store III: 20 truckloads of root beer
* Store IV: 15 truckloads of root beer


The table below gives the cost of transportation, per truckload of root beer, from each plant to each store:

Plant/Distribution  | Store I | Store II  | Store III  | Store IV
------------------- | ------- | ------    | --------   | --------
Plant A             | 290     | 280       | 500        | 250  
Plant B             | 260     | 290       | 200        | 500



The current distribution system that the company was using before you were hired is shown in the table below. The unit of measurement is the truckload:

Plant/Distribution  | Store I | Store II  | Store III  | Store IV  | Supply
------------------- | ------- | ------    | --------   | --------  | ------
Plant A             | 5       | 0         | 0          | 15        | 20
Plant B             | 10      | 10        | 20         | 0         | 40
Demand              | 15      | 10        | 20         | 15



The job for you is to determine the quantity (i.e., the number of truckloads) of root beer that should be shipped from each plant to each warehouse so that the company's total shipping cost is minimized.


1. Create the initial simplex tableau. (10)


2. Solve the problem using the simplex method, and generate a chart showing the optimized flows that you have generated for their distribution system. What is the minimized cost, and how much savings have you found for the company? (20)

3. The key to consulting is getting repeat business from your clients, so you're happy when the CEO of Paez Pop calls you back months later to ask you to do some more work.

His company's root beer has become so successful that they now estimate potential demand at Store I and Store IV has increased by 10 truckloads of root beer a month, at each of the two stores. This extra demand has been going unmet, for now, because they haven't yet had the ability to expand production capacity at either plant, and haven't modified their distribution system since you optimized it for them in question 2.

Paez Pop has now saved up enough money to expand one, and only one, of their two plants by 20 truckloads of extra root beer production, so they can meet this new demand. The CEO knows the two plants have different transportation costs to the four stores, so he is wondering if you can tell him which of the two facilities he should expand, in order to minimize his company's transportation costs.

Find which plant, when its production is increased by 20, will find Paez Pop the higher savings. (25)


NEW QUESTION

4. A few years pass, and Paez Pop has continued to expand. They have now added afternoon and night shifts, bringing total production at each plant up to 100 truckloads of beer a month. As well, as their brand has become more popular they have seen increased demand at the four original stores, and they have even started supplying their root beer to two new stores (Store V and Store VI). 

Instead of coming to you to redesign their distribution system, they've just added transportation routes in an ad-hoc manner, so their current distribution system now looks like this:


Plant/Distribution  | Store I | Store II  | Store III  | Store IV  | Store V | Store VI | Supply
------------------- | ------- | ------    | --------   | --------  | ------  | -------- | ------
Plant A             | 30      | 0         | 0          | 40        | 0       | 30       |  100
Plant B             | 10      | 20        | 30         | 0         | 40      | 0        |  100
Demand              | 40      | 20        | 30         | 40        | 40      | 30       | 

Their transportation costs haven't changed for Stores I-IV. Transportation costs to the two new stores are as follows:

Plant/Distribution  | Store V | Store VI  
------------------- | ------- | ------   
Plant A             | 680     | 190       
Plant B             | 400     | 460      

They have now come back to you to optimize their distribution system again. Determine minimized cost, create a chart of optimal flows, and state how much money you've saved them. (30)

NEW QUESTION

5. Paez Pop is thinking of trying to reduce costs by investing in a new, futuristic transportation trend: they're going to fire all their truck drivers at Plant B, and replace them with shiny new electric-powered autonomous vehicles from Tesla. They think this will save them 20% on all transport costs from plant B to each of the six stores. 

(Plant A's truck drivers can't be replaced because they're unionized, so Plant A's transport costs will remain the same.)

By how many percent would this plan reduce Paez Pop's total transport costs in a new optimized network? What do the flows look like now?
